# Draw

Draw (catchy title pending) is a browser-based game in development that will be similar to Pictionary and Draw Something. Players will join a lobby and all will be given the same thign to draw. Once all players have finished drwaing, each drawing will be played back stroke-by-stroke. Players will then be able to vote on the best and funniest drawings that match the subject.

The front-end is made with Pug and jQuery, while the backend is Node.js.
