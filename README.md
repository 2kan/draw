# Draw

Draw (catchy title pending) is a browser-based game in development that will be similar to Pictionary and Draw Something. Players will join a lobby and all will be given the same thign to draw. Once all players have finished drwaing, each drawing will be played back stroke-by-stroke. Players will then be able to vote on the best and funniest drawings that match the subject.

The front-end is made with Pug and jQuery, while the backend is Node.js.

To test it out for yourself, clone the repo and install the npm packages with `npm install`. Start the server with `node draw` and compile the pug file with `pug public/index.pug`, then open up a browser and head to `http://localhost:3000/index.html`!
